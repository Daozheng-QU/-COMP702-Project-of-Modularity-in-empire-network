'''Acknowledgement:

I am very grateful to my first supervisor for answering too many questions about the project,
such as understanding errors during the conversion of the Empire graph, such as improving code efficiency, etc.,
I also thanks to Senior Chen Sheng for giving me inspiration on the traversal (single line of code) on the opposite side of the empire graph,
which will enable me to better complete the transformation of the empire graph.'''
